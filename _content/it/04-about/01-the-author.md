## About the author

![Headshot of Julie McMurry](images/en/Julie-McMurry.png)

I have a masters degree in public health from the [University of London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine](http://lshtm.ac.uk/) as well as a background in infectious diseases and vaccine development. The impact of this pandemic will be needlessly amplified by misinformation, so be careful. I've endeavored to be as accurate as possible without causing panic. I have not been paid to write this post, but given my training I do feel like it is my responsibility. This is a volunteer effort that qualified people are welcome to help contribute to. Frankly the only reason it is not anonymous is because it would be less likely to be taken seriously, and we need all of the gravitas we can get right now.

Full disclosure, I worked in the TB and HIV vaccine field from 2000-2010 but have since switched gears into rare disease genetics. I'm currently an assistant professor (senior research) at Oregon State University in the College of Public Health; to learn more about our group's work in computer models for rare genetic disease feel free to have a look at [tislab.org](http://tislab.org/).
