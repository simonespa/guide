## Hot zone
**Prepare a hot zone in your home just in case someone falls ill**

Prepare your home for the possibility you'll need to isolate and care for an infected member of your household. Stock the room in advance with food that the infected person can consume with zero preparation and without face-to-face interaction with others. If you have a dedicated bathroom for the infected person, that is best. Realistically, given shortages you won't have access to a mask, but if you do have one, prioritize its use on the infected person rather than caretakers.
