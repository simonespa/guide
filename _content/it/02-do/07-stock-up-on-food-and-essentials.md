"Experts aren't telling you to stock up on essentials because they think you're going to run out of food & society is going to collapse. It's
because a [few days of panic buying & high demands cause more panic & stress systems unnecessarily](https://twitter.com/firefoxx66/status/1233666678841597952). Also, being in line with hundreds of people isn't wise. Go off peak. Buy a little more than what you need. Preparedness isn't about doing nothing, but also about not overreacting. It's about doing your part to put the [\*slack in our systems\*](https://twitter.com/firefoxx66/status/1233666678841597952) so that short disruptions are smooth as possible, can absorb extra load, & resources remain available for those most in need.

Don't bother buying bottled water; tap water is very unlikely to be impacted and anyway, boiling would be adequate if it turned out it were
needed for unforeseen reasons. Intestinal symptoms of coronavirus are very rare; there's no reason to expect that supplies of toilet paper will dry up. Get what you need. Leave the rest for others.
