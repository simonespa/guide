## Look beyond yourself

At all times, be kind to each other and be mindful of other people's worries. [You may be in a low risk group and feel this is nothing to

[With all the cancellations this is one of the first times I've seen normalization of an "it's everybody's problem approach." Yes, your one cancelled event might not save lives but the fact that everyone is doing this will.

This will reduce coronavirus transmission, support your local economy, and also have a net carbon savings.
